Description:

Unfortunately more often than not life feels like it's being coded only in HTML. It's black and white. There is little variation and
we find that our life is static. Where is the CSS? Where can we find the colour, quirks, inspirations, beauty, and dance?! It's found 
in human emotion. Feelings are our CSS. And, it is through new experiences and rich human interaction where these feelings are felt.  

So wouldn't it be great to always have a tool on you for you to find your CSS? Wouldn't it be great if you could find those feelings?

Drumroll... CoGeo.

CoGeo is an app that recommends places for you to go based on how you are feeling.

If you're feeling outgoing, CoGeo knows where you should go.

If you're feeling relaxed, CoGeo knows where you should go.

If you're feeling Explorative, CoGeo knows where you should go.

It's a very smart app.

however the upload functionality was not.
